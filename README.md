# libvirtd-collectd

This is a simple container wrapping libvirtd, augmented adding collectd configured
to monitor the processes running inside the container, and report their metrics
through collectd.

## How to use in a kubevirt cluster?

1. Grab kubevirt sources. Supported version is
   - k8s provider: 0.7.z
   - ocp provider: 0.8.z
   The last tested version is:
   - k8s provider: 0.7.0
   - ocp provider: 0.8.0-alpha.2
2. Apply [this patch](https://github.com/fromanirh/kubevirt/commit/3292207e65294bbd630a9be138c69cf2ee2cf37b). Now your kubevirt installation support pod metrics.
3. Apply [this other patch](https://github.com/fromanirh/kubevirt/commit/007112d9ef3a2fdd654221cc2666d3edbdbb01fc). Now your VM pods are transparently instrumented to report metrics.
4. To get pod metrics, you need [to configure node\_exporter](https://github.com/fromanirh/libvirt-collectd/blob/master/manifests/k8s/node-exporter-daemonset.yaml).
   You can use [those manifests](https://github.com/fromanirh/libvirt-collectd/tree/master/manifests/k8s) in [this order](https://github.com/fromanirh/libvirt-collectd/blob/master/apply.sh) to deploy a pre-configured prometheus.
5. Done! You can now access prometheus server.

## Notes for developers

1. if you run on top of kubevirt development cluster, you most likely to need this last step to indeed access your prometheus server:

   `port-forward -n <prometheus_pod_namespace>  <prometheus_pod_name> 36000:9090`

2. Setting up the kubevirt cluster and its monitoring requires running  commands in well defined folders (example: kubevirt's ./cluster/kubectl.sh, or applying the manifests bundled here).
   To help doing this, you can follow those steps
   - use the provided `make-apply.sh`. Run it with the parameters fit to your cluster from a checkout of this repository. The output is *another* script that you can run in the kubevirt top-level directory.
   Example:
   ```
     cd $WORKDIR/libvirt-collectd
     ./make-apply.sh ocp ./cluster/kubectl.sh > /tmp/apply.sh
     cd $WORKDIR/kubevirt
     # make sure you have the patches applied!
     export KUBEVIRT_PROVIDER=os-3.10.0
     make
     make cluster-up
     make cluster-sync
     sh /tmp/apply.sh
   ```

   Now your cluster is ready!
